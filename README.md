# telegram-bot-referral

I need the help of a specialist who will teach and instruct me how to create a channel/group in the application "telegram(android)" and configure a bot to operate it. The main task of the bot will be to get users to my referral programs, creation of ads, ect.

Suggested: Define the bot's intended purpose, role, format, and objectives for the referral programs and ads.

Suggested: Identify and suggest features to enhance the bot's functionality for promoting referral programs and ads.
